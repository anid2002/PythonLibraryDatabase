# Architecture Description

The programming language for this library database management system is Python. Because Python was used, Tkinter was a reasonable GUI framework to use along with Python. This is due to Tkinter's easy nature with Python. The SQL language used in this database management system is SQLite. The CSV files are in the data folder, the Python file is in the src folder, and the libDataBase.db file is in the root. The architectural decision the team working on this has made was to write all of the code in one main.py file in the src folder. This was to avoid confusion. It was written systematically. The first action done in the main.py file is the CSV files in the data folder are read and put into data frames. After that, a book_loans table and a fines table are created in the SQLite database. After that are the search click methods, checkout method, check-in method, borrower creation methods, fines methods, and update day method in that order. After that, the GUI window is created, and all of the buttons for each method are written.
